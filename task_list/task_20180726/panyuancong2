# Blockchain Tour #
Blockchain is an emerging hot technology. As a programmer, I will explore and explore it. As an important concept of Bitcoin, it implements a decentralized payment system. My understanding of the blockchain comes from this.
It’s about 15 years. It’s the first time I found out that I can make money through computer calculations. It’s so cool. By checking the information of the ancestors, the wallet, the mining pool, etc. are registered step by step, and the computer is set to the best state. Everyone should see me laughing here, yes, I want to laugh at myself now. Staying in the dormitory, running for a day, getting the reward, I feel sorry for the electricity bill I paid. Later, when I was in a good position, there would be a lot of practical lessons in my major. Every time I went to the computer room of the school, I occupied the computer. . . . . The gains are still minimal. But from there, I started my blockchain journey!
## 一, Blockchain knowledge learning ##
I first read Nakamoto's white paper. After all, as the origin of the blockchain, it is necessary to see through. The understanding of this is that we previously needed Alipay's third-party trusted intermediary to protect our transactions, but this will obviously increase the cost of buyers and sellers. With the decentralization of the blockchain, it is possible to establish trust directly and trade directly. Then there is learning the GO language, reading blockchain development guides, modern cryptography, and more. This is mainly to clarify the basic concepts and common nouns. For example, the structure of the GO language, commonly used variables, language development tools, etc., while conducting some technical attempts.
## II. Understanding of blockchain ##
The blockchain is like a book for all people, and everyone can book it. Since everyone has a backup, even if you lose it, it will not be affected. And it is safe, because a small number of computers are unable to control the central ledger and other people's books. It can be said that it is a reliable distributed data storage library. On the other hand, blockchain technology is not a single technology, but the result of the integration of multiple technologies. For example, it includes P2P-based value transfer protocols, public and private key verification, consensus processes, serialization blocks, and so on.
## 三, Blockchain's TrueChain ##
1. In recent years, many companies have begun to develop blockchains. I have paid attention to one of them, TrueChain. As a pioneer of a fast, secure, unrestricted, and scalable hybrid consensus chain, TrueChain combines PBFT and POW consensus to ensure the performance requirements required in value distribution and business applications, while meeting the decentralization The security and freedom of liberation can be said to be a perfect mixed-consensus public chain with great development space and potential.
2, TrueChain involves four layers: the underlying service, the core layer, the API interface layer, and the smart contract. Here is a brief introduction, such as smart contracts. It runs on TVM. The TrueChain virtual machine draws on the design of Ethereum's virtual machine (EVM) and implants each of the decision-making backbone nodes so that they can make requests based on individual requirements. Also for example, the data is evenly distributed among the sub-slices, ensuring that each time the corresponding slice is called, a consistent value is returned. Each data unit contains metadata.
3, application areas: TrueChain has real and reliable applications in many aspects. Including insurance, medical, games, public interest, asset securitization, digital advertising industry, micropayments, value transfer, digital copyright, etc. In the case of the last digital copyright, the video's motion changes, colors, and other feature records can abstract out independent authentication, thereby protecting the video content on the network, and at the same time effectively tracking to prevent the occurrence of piracy and traceability. The source of piracy.

4、 the view of the blockchain
Through the application field of TrueChain, it is not difficult to find that the blockchain has broad development prospects, and more and more technology Internet companies are investing in the hot IP. I believe that in the future, the blockchain will change the world, change the future, and play an important role in various fields! For me, the blockchain as an emerging technology, if you can participate in it, use its technology to learn to solve the public's problems, I believe I will find a piece of the world in the wave of blockchain. But at the same time, we also need to know that the blockchain is designed with the least efficiency in the initial design, that is, all the data is equally divided into all clients, that is, distributed structure. This is contrary to our high performance today. And because of the anonymity of the transaction, like the ransomware that broke out last year, it was paid by bitcoin. How to avoid illegal crimes, I think this is a problem that the blockchain needs to solve. But in short, make good use of and develop blockchain, I believe it will become our right hand!
